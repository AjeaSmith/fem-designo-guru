## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Overview: Out of all the projects I've done on this site, this is one of my favorites, mostly because I've learned so much. I used a combination of chatGPT, CSS god Kevin Powell, and Coder Coder throughout this project.

Things I learned

- Positioning PNG images with object-fit and object position (helpful link)
- On mobile, show overlay when the mobile menu is open (helpful video by Kevin Powell)
- For loops in SCSS for background images (chatGPT).
- Rotation of background images (chatGPT)

### Continued development

- Media queries and breakpoint ranges
- Utilize sass
- Struture sass folder files
